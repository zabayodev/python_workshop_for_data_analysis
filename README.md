# Python Workshop for Data Analysis
Dear Python for Data Analysis workshop Series Followers,

Thank you for your continued support and interest in our workshop series! Weâ€™re excited to have you on this journey with us as we explore the powerful world of Python for Data Analysis.

As we prepare for our first workshop, we want to let you know that our website is still a work in progress. For now, we will be using a Microsoft Teams link as the stable platform for our live sessions. Rest assured, we are actively working on developing a dedicated website for future cohorts. This website will serve as the hub for all workshop-related activities, including the call for applications, event schedules, and details about our partners.

We appreciate your patience and look forward to providing you with an even better experience as we continue to grow. Stay tuned for more updates, and thank you for being part of this exciting learning community!

Best regards,
Organizing Commitee
