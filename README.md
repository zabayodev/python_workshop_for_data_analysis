Dear Python for Data Analysis workshop Followers,

Thank you for your continued support and interest in our workshop series! We’re excited to have you on this journey with us as we explore the powerful world of Python for Data Analysis.

As we prepare for our first workshop, we want to let you know that our website is still a work in progress.

Dear Python for Data Analysis Series Followers,

Thank you for your continued support and interest in our workshop series! We’re excited to have you on this journey with us as we explore the powerful world of Python for Data Analysis.

As we prepare for our first workshop, we want to share some key details about the event structure:

We will hold two main lectures each week, with each session lasting 3 hours.
An additional 3 hours per week will be reserved for one-on-one mentorship with our experienced mentors. This will be based on participant requests, ensuring personalized guidance and support.
We are committed to maintaining clear and effective communication, as it is the pillar of any successful event. All participants selected for the cohort will receive formal updates about the series through both email and WhatsApp. We’ll make sure you have all the information you need to make the most of this learning experience.

Please note that more detailed information about the event will be available on our event page (once finalized) and will be added to the Google Form for easy reference. We appreciate your patience as we finalize these details.

Stay tuned for more updates, and thank you for being part of this exciting learning community!
