# Python Workshop for Data Analysis
Dear Python for Data Analysis workshop Followers,

Thank you for your continued support and interest in our workshop series! We’re excited to have you on this journey with us as we explore the powerful world of Python for Data Analysis.

As we prepare for our first workshop, we want to let you know that our website is still a work in progress. For now, we will be using a Microsoft Teams link as the stable platform for our live sessions. Rest assured, we are actively working on developing a dedicated website for future cohorts. This website will serve as the hub for all workshop-related activities, including the call for applications, event schedules and details about our partners.

We appreciate your patience and look forward to providing you with an even better experience as we continue to grow. Stay tuned for more updates and thank you for being part of this exciting learning community!

Best regards,
Organizing Commitee

# Python for Data Analysis structure

We will hold two main lectures each week with each session lasting 3 hours. An additional 3 hours per week will be reserved for one-on-one mentorship with our experienced mentors. This will be based on participant requests by ensuring a personalized guidance and support. We are committed to maintaining clear and effective communication, as it is the pillar of any successful event. All participants selected for this cohort will receive formal updates about the class series through both email and WhatsApp group to make sure that none is left behind. We’ll make sure you have all the information you need to make the most of this learning experience.

Please note that more detailed information about the event will be available on our event page (once finalized) and will be added to the Google Form for easy reference. We appreciate your patience as we finalize these details.
